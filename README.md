This project explores airline pricing and flight characteristics to assist a hypothetical travel agency in finding the best deals for clients. The dataset includes factors such as distance traveled, delays, inflight services, and flight timing, allowing the analysis of their impact on both coach and first-class ticket prices. Developed as part of _Codecademy's Data Science Foundation II curriculum_

Key Features:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
- Visualization of trends across flight duration, amenities, and pricing
- Insights into how flight features (weekend, redeye, inflight wifi) affect ticket cost
